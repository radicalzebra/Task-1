Hello, My name is **Arshad Faiyaz **, this is my implementation of **Task-1******

******Steps:******

******1.Started my VM instance running kali******

******2.Installed nmap via nmap.org******

******3.Found my IP range using ifconfig command which gave me my instance IP & netmask******

******4.Used command **nmap -sS -A -oN portscan 192.168.x.x/24 **to perform a TCP SYN scan**********

******5.Scanned all hosts within the IP range******

******6.Found SSH running on port 22 and DNS running on port 63******

******7.Found other info such as the Operating System of the host IP and MAC (using -A flag) and saved the output to a file (using -oN flag)******

******8.Potential Security Risks found are **DNS cache Poisoning **& **DNS Tunneling************

******9.Used **Wireshark **to analyse the packets**********

******Thank you ðŸ˜Ž******
